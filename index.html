					<h4>B.A. Mathematics</h4>
					I began at Emmanuel College thinking I would become a psychologist. I quickly realized how much I missed mathematics. 
					<br> Second semester I retook Calculus I, and from there I knew I wanted to be a math major. Throughout my mathematics career
					I worked with my favorite Professor, Brendan Sullivan, and another student, Niko Townsend. We worked on game theory, specifically
					the game Cops and Robbers. We spent our summers working on proving the run time Cops and Robbers on the rooks graph. This led to
					back to back presentations at the Joint Mathematics Meeting, as well as a talk at the Young Mathematicians Conference in Ohio.
					Most notably from my time at Emmanuel, Professor Sullivan, Niko and I were able to collaborate on a publication in the College
					Mathematics Journal. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/college.math.j.48.5.322?seq=1">An Introduction To Lazy Cops and 
						Robbers on Graphs</a> was published just after the end of my senior year at Emmanuel.
