					<h3>TraceLink</h3>
					<h4>Data Analyst, Network Success <br>August 2017-March 2018</h4>
					<p>I was hired at <a href="https://www.tracelink.com">TraceLink</a> in August of 2017 as a data analyst. TraceLink is a platform for track and trace and pharmaceutical 
					serialization. My role within the company entailed created a weekly checking tool and statistics report of the companies that had been integrated into TraceLink's Life Sciences Cloud.
					On a day to day basis I was creating, combining and splitting entities to build a network that mirrored real world operations 
					of the pharmaceutical industry. After 6 months in this position my manager recommended me to a team that was expanding within 
					our organization. From that recommendation I was hired as a Validation Specialist.

					<h4>Validation Specialist Sr., Automated Validation Manager<br>March 2018-Present</h4>
					<p>I began this as an entry level role but quickly established my presence on the team after my direct manager departed from the company.
					I work with the Compliance, Product Management and Development teams to create, update and validate customer facing test cases for the 
					Validation Test Kit on elements of the TraceLink product to conform to pharmaceutical validation requirements. My product feeds the
					Automated Validation Manager. <br><br></p>

					<h3>Emmanuel College</h3>
					<h4>B.A. in Mathematics, May 2017</h4>
					<p>I began at Emmanuel College thinking I would become a psychologist. I quickly realized how much I missed mathematics. 
					<br> My second semester I retook Calculus I, and from there I knew I wanted to be a math major. Throughout my mathematics career
					I worked with my favorite Professor, Brendan Sullivan, and another student, Niko Townsend. We worked on game theory, specifically
					the game Cops and Robbers. We spent our summers working on proving the run time Cops and Robbers on the rooks graph. This led to
					back to back presentations at the Joint Mathematics Meeting, as well as a talk at the Young Mathematicians Conference in Ohio.
					Most notably from my time at Emmanuel, Professor Sullivan, Niko and I were able to collaborate on a publication in the College
					Mathematics Journal. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/college.math.j.48.5.322?seq=1">An Introduction To Lazy Cops and 
						Robbers on Graphs</a> was published just after the end of my senior year at Emmanuel.
