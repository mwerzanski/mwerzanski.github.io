					<h3>TraceLink</h3>
					<h4>Data Analyst, Network Success <br>August 2017-March 2018</h4>
					<p>I was hired at <a href="https://www.tracelink.com">TraceLink</a> in August of 2017 as a data analyst. TraceLink is a platform for track and trace and pharmaceutical 
					serialization. My role within the company entailed created a weekly checking tool and statistics report of the companies that had been integrated into TraceLink's Life Sciences Cloud.
					On a day to day basis I was creating, combining and splitting entities to build a network that mirrored real world operations 
					of the pharmaceutical industry. After 6 months in this position my manager recommended me to a team that was expanding within 
					our organization. From that recommendation I was hired as a Validation Specialist.
					<br></p>
					<h4>Validation Specialist Sr., Automated Validation Manager<br>March 2018-Present</h4>
					<p>I began this as an entry level role but quickly established my presence on the team after my direct manager departed from the company.
					I work with the Compliance, Product Management and Development teams to create, update and validate customer facing test cases for the 
					Validation Test Kit on elements of the TraceLink product to conform to pharmaceutical validation requirements. My product feeds the
					Automated Validation Manager. <br><br></p>

					<h3>Northeastern</h3>
					<h4>M.S. Computer Science <br>Expected Graduation Date: December 2021</h4>
					<p>
						I am currently in my second year of the ALIGN program at Northeastern. ALIGN program is made for students who did not already have a B.S.
						in Computer Science. My GPA is currently a 3.2 and I have learned several different languages. My plan is to specialize in software 
						engineering and game design. So far, for graduate courses, I have taken Algorithms. I am currently enrolled in Web Development and Foundations
						of Software Engineering. On my <a href="/css/Projects">Projects</a> page I have posted a
						<a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu/mwerzanski/Animation">link</a> to a Github repo for an animation I created in Object Oriented Design during 
						the spring semester of 2020.

					<h3>ClearSky Data</h3>
					<h4>Mathematics Intern<br>May 2016-February 2017</h4>
					<p>
						I began as a mathematics intern on the engineering team at ClearSky Data in May of 2016. During my time there I created excel models
						for read and write data patterns. This turned into a project where I developed a python program to model specific data paths for
						potential customers. After creating this python program I was able to employ the use of MATLAB from a class I was in to generate graphs
						of my cost model and latency model for the data system. While working for the engineering team I was also asked to help construct some 
						cost models for customer pricing.
						It was during this time working with marketing that I was able to find an Amazon service the company had been paying for but not taking
						advantage of. It turns out that they had meant to disolve this service but hadn't fully communicated that they would no longer need
						Amazon for that account.

					<h3>Emmanuel College</h3>
					<h4>B.A. in Mathematics, May 2017</h4>
					<p>I began at Emmanuel College thinking I would become a psychologist. I quickly realized how much I missed mathematics. 
					<br> My second semester I retook Calculus I, and from there I knew I wanted to be a math major. Throughout my mathematics career
					I worked with my favorite Professor, Brendan Sullivan, and another student, Niko Townsend. We worked on game theory, specifically
					the game Cops and Robbers. We spent our summers working on proving the run time Cops and Robbers on the rooks graph. This led to
					back to back presentations at the Joint Mathematics Meeting, as well as a talk at the Young Mathematicians Conference in Ohio.
					Most notably from my time at Emmanuel, Professor Sullivan, Niko and I were able to collaborate on a publication in the College
					Mathematics Journal. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/college.math.j.48.5.322?seq=1">An Introduction To Lazy Cops and 
						Robbers on Graphs</a> was published just after the end of my senior year at Emmanuel.
