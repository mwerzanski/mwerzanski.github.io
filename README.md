## A writeup responding to the following questions and ideas(at least 3 sentences per bullet point):
### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
I found it challenging most of the way through, but I think that comes with my unfamiliarity on the subject thus far. I think that given more time I could have created a more personal view of my life and work experience. This is also the first time I have created a personal website so in doing so I wasn't sure what was expected of my site.

### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I thought that the table would be better suited as a width of 100% on a mobile screen. I also thought a single column approach would be better than the side by side pictures and text.

### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?
I took into account the ease of access, as well as the visual aspect of the project. I wanted to make sure there was as many pictures as possible to go along with telling my story.

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
Given more time I would have really liked to have made this more interactive. I would have liked to have pictures of me scrolling with the user. I used <a href="http://www.garysheng.com">Gary Sheng's</a> website as an example and I think it is much better than what I was able to put forth during this project. I hope that after this class I am able to create something more of this caliber.

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent around 15 hours on the assignment. Having been entirely unfamiliar with html and css coming in to this class I feel it likely took me longer than most to get up to speed with this project.


### If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here
I struggled for quite some time with adding any css styling from my main.css document to my website. So, for testing purposes I looked
to an <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">example</a>. I could not get their or my styling to work when using NEU's github so I tested again with the example code on a personal github page. Once I confirmed that their code worked with a css styling page I started with my own project.
