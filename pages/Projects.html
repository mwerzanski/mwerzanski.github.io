                        My project at ClearSky was as a mathematics intern. I began by creating an excel spreadsheet to calculate 
                        the latencies within ClearSky's system. I was tasked with finding the time it took for a certain amount of data
                        to be written and read from directed paths that a customers data would travel. Once I had gotten an initial grasp 
                        on the project I was told that I needed to transfer the excel model into a python script and increase the scale.
                        <br> I had never used any sort of programming language before this, I had been told for the position I would not to
                        know need it, so I had to dive into learning python immediately. After several weeks I was able to present a model 
                        to the engineering team that modeled the data through their system for potential customers. The model showed the
                        developers where they could improve on latency times and where the system performed efficiently. During this 
                        presentation I allowed the other engineers to enter data into my program, and immediately they were able to find a bug.
                        That was my first lesson, always have a working set of test data, or an even safer option would be to record the 
                        program in an operational state.<br>I created this model thoughout the summer after my junior year and well into my 
                        senior year in 2016. This program was used by the team up until the company dissolved at the end of 2019.
