                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I started noticing increased stomach pain when I was a junior in High School. It started right after a severe case of mono.
                        I would be in the middle of class or soccer and I would need to make a run to the nearest bathroom. At 16 I was diagnosed with
                        Crohn's Disease. Crohn's Disease is an autoimmune disease that would affect me for the rest of my life. It means that during my 
                        endoscopy and colonoscopy they saw inflammation throughout both my small and large intestine. The first treatment I was placed on
                        was Aesocol.

                    <h3>Freshman Year of College</h3>
                    <p>By this time I had moved on from 2 previous drug courses and I was on something called Pentasa. I had to take 2 pills 4 times a day. 
                        Is that possible for a freshman who just went off on her own for the first time? Well, for me, it wasn't even close to the realm of 
                        possibility. I was missing days of the prescription at a time, but for a while that didn't seem to affect me. After first semester I
                        had gained weight, the freshman 15 was more like the freshman 20 for me. I was on a diet by Christmas, but by the end of the school year
                        I could barely even look at food because of how much pain I was in. I would call my mother crying about how hungry I was but how I wasn't
                        able to even go to the cafeteria without immediately running to the bathroom. They repeated all of the original tests and re-diagnosed me with  
                        Ulcerative Colitis. There was still a possibility I had Crohn's Disease, but the inflammation seemed to be mainly focused on my colon. <br>
                        I didn't feel like I was able to be a normal college student. I wanted to fit in and make friends, but its hard to do that when I couldn't
                        even leave my room. Thankfully, at the beginning of the semester I had gone to Disability Services on campus and had the ability to have 
                        my professors sign a statement about the potential of me missing class more often than a normal student. I took full advantage of this when
                        I was unable to get out of bed with all of the pain I was in.<br>After the second semester ended, it appeared that my most recent flare up was 
                        over and I was ready to start living a more normal life again.

                    <h3>Sophomore Year of College</h3>
                    <p>
                        Halfway through my sophomore year at Emmanuel, I was again in the midst of a flare up. After meeting with my doctor, we started me on a new course of
                        medication, called mercaptopurine, or 6MP. By now, I knew the pain of not taking my medication, so I was able to get on a regular schedule. After 
                        2-3 weeks on this new 
                        treatment I came home for a weekend because my sister and I both appeared to have the stomach bug, but while my sister got better after a few days 
                        I was still extremely sick. I was no longer eating, or even tolerating a sip of water or gatorade. After 5 days of not being able to kick this bug
                        my mom took me to my primary care doctor. I was sent to Anna Jacques in Newburyport for some blood testing. As soon as the tests came back my doctor
                        called my parents and told them to get me to Children's Hospital immediately. I had pancreatitis.<br>We drove into Boston and I was given morphine
                        immediately for all of the pain I had attributed to having the stomach bug. I was in the 2% of people that developed pancreatitis from mercaptopurine.
                        After just 10 minutes my mom realized I had hives spreading all down my back. Not only did I get pancreatits from one of my UC maintenance drugs, I 
                        was having an allergic reaction to the morphine they had given me to help with the pain I was in. It just didn't seem like I could catch a break. I
                        was in the hospital for a week and during that time they started me on a new treatment for my Ulcerative Colitis: Remicade.<br>Remicade is an IV
                        infusion that I would take for the next two years at increasingly smaller increments. I started off getting the treatment once every 8 weeks. It took
                        about 2 hours for the full infusion to finish, so I was usually in the hospital for at least 3 hours, but Emmanuel is right down the street so that
                        made things easy since I would walk there. After about 6 months I noticed that the 8 week period was just too long between treatments, my stomach
                        would flare right before I went for my next treatment. I moved from 8 weeks between infusions to 6 weeks and then again after 6 months we moved to 4
                        weeks between treatments. It just seemed destined that no medication would continue to work.

                    <h3>Graduating from Emmanuel</h3>
                    <p>
                        By graduation I was on another course of treatment called Sulfasalizine. I would take two pills twice a day, but again I was back to being unable to
                        take my meds regularly. My stomach would hurt, but I paid it no mind because I was graduating college. I was sick of missing out on things so I just
                        ignored the pain and did what I wanted and ate what I wanted. <br>That didn't work for long. One night at the end of August, the night before I was supposed to
                        start my new grown up job, I was in excrutiating pain. I emailed my new boss that I was extremely sick and unable to come in to work and headed 
                        straght for Bsoton Children's Hospital. I was admitted for a week while they tried to get my disease under control. I was running out of options for
                        treatment.<br>I was started on a new drug, humira, I knew what it was because of commercials about it, but I didn't expect the pain that came with the
                        injections. They had to give me a "loading dose", which was 4 injections, and then in two weeks I would take two injections, and as maintence I would
                        give myself 1 injection every two weeks.<br>I went to Aruba halfway through October with my family and then entire time I was there I was running between
                        the bathroom and the beach. It was not the best way to vacation. I barely went out when everyone else did because I just needed a bathroom nearby at all
                        times. I had to change my flights to come home earlier and the day after I returned I was in my GI's office. He immediately admitted me to the hospital.
                        I was there for two weeks. During that time I was told that I was almost out of treatment options. There was one more thing we would try but it came with
                        a lot of risk. I would have to get blood work every two weeks religiously, to make sure that my liver was handling the treatment. I was on tacrolimus,
                        which is normally used as an anti-rejection medication for transplant patients. I went home on November 7th and had a followup with Dr. Raphael on the 21st.

                    <h3>The Final Steps</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before my followup appointment I was getting ready for the day and ended up curled over in pain. I was sick to my stomach from the pain I was in. My mom
                        had to drive me because I was in so much pain and once we met with my doctor we were posed with the question "Should I get you an ambulance to Boston or
                        would you like to drive her?" My mom drove me into Boston on what felt like the longest drive of my life. I was writhing in pain in the passenger seat of
                        her car. As soon as I arrived at the hospital they had me sign one form before squeezing me into a room and getting and placing an IV so they could manage
                        my pain. A surgeon, Dr. Z, met me in the ER and took one look at me asking "So, are we going to do the surgery?" In my last hospital stint, I had been 
                        told that if tacrolimus didn't work there was almost no other option than removing the colon. We set a date. December 1st, 2017 I was getting the surgery.
                        <br>The surgery happened in 3 parts over the course of 6 months. In December, I got my colon removed and I had a ileostomy placed. In March, I had a J-Pouch
                        created. And lastly, in June, all of my small intestine was reconnected and I was able to go to the bathroom "normally" for the first time since I was 16.

                    <h3>Goodbye Letter to my Colon</h3>
                    <p>
                        My mother wrote this letter for me so that I could finally say goodbye to this part of my life:
                        Dear Colon,
                        <br>It is with a heavy heart that I write this as my final goodbye. Over the last five years we have had some tumultuous times. You have let me down in so
                        many ways and have thrown one too many tantrums. On more than one occassion you have humiliated me, reducing me to a puddle of tears. You have caused me so
                        much unneccessary pain. It is time I take back my life. I have made the courageous decision and finally it is time that we part ways.
                        <br>"Why?" you ask? Simply put, I DON'T NEED YOU ANY MORE! I am tired of your constant bathroom demands and your refusal to digest my food properly, along
                        with your spastic response to my enjoyment of food. You have left me no choice. We are through.
                        <br>"One last change?" you beg? I don't think so. I have given you too many opportunities for reform. Asacol, Lialda, Pentasa, 6MP, Remicade, Humira, Prednisone,
                        Tacrolymus...you balked at all. No, this is it, my decision is final.
                        <br>"Calm down", you say? You think "I am overracting"? HA! I say to you. You have been overreacting and misbehaving for months now. This is the last straw for
                        me. I know that it is going to be difficult at first. Painful even. But it offers me hope. Hope to be free to live the life I deserve. Hope to be the twenty-two
                        year old that I am. No more holding back on things that make me happy for fear of your disapproval. Sure there will be an adjustment period. But don't you worry,
                        I've got this in the bag! I know that things will be a little twisty inside, but it will be my choice and not because you say so.
                        <br>Thanks for the memories...the late night trips to the bathroom, the refusal to allow me to have a few drinks with friends and the adventures you forced upon
                        me in new places in search of a bathroom. We will always have the memories.
                        <br>So long, Colon. This is the end of our road.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Me Now</h3>
                    <p>
                        The surgeries came with their own sets of challenges, but so far I haven't regretted any of it. In 2020, I am finally able to go out with friends without
                        having to worry about where a bathroom is. I go to the bathroom 4-6 times a day, which is much more than your average person, but I have none of the urgency
                        that came with Ulcerative Colitis. Technically, if I was diagnosed correctly, I am "cured" of UC. If I was diagnosed incorrectly, and they were right originally
                        about me having Crohn's, then I may still have issues with inflammation, only in my small intestine rather than my non-existent colon.
