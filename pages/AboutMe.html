                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I started noticing increased stomach pain when I was a junior in High School. It started right after a severe case of mono.
                        I would be in the middle of class or soccer and I would need to make a run to the nearest bathroom. At 16 I was diagnosed with
                        Crohn's Disease. Crohn's Disease is an autoimmune disease that would affect me for the rest of my life. It means that during my 
                        endoscopy and colonoscopy they saw inflammation throughout both my small and large intestine. The first treatment I was placed on
                        was Aesocol.

                    <h3>Freshman Year of College</h3>
                    <p>By this time I had moved on from 2 previous drug courses and I was on something called Pentasa. I had to take 2 pills 4 times a day. 
                        Is that possible for a freshman who just went off on her own for the first time? Well, for me, it wasn't even close to the realm of 
                        possibility. I was missing days of the prescription at a time, but for a while that didn't seem to affect me. After first semester I
                        had gained weight, the freshman 15 was more like the freshman 20 for me. I was on a diet by Christmas, but by the end of the school year
                        I could barely even look at food because of how much pain I was in. They repeated all of the original tests and re-diagnosed me with                         Ulcerative Colitis. There was still a possibility I had Crohn's Disease, but the inflammation seemed to be mainly in my colon. <br>
